# BookList-App

- This project is a copy of Brad Traversy's app tutorial process of the same name. The goal is to recreate the app without looking at the video tutorial to get familiar with OOP in Javascript. This was a pretty fun project to recreate and the process made me feel more comfortable with Javascript classes.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the fields for book details
- Add the book when submit is clicked and see a success message
- Add the book details in the table
- Be able to delete a book on button click
- See an error message when field/s are not filled in
- Store the changes of the table in localStorage

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons

### What I learned

- This project made me more comfortable with OOP in Javascript.
- I also started to use font awesome again and I think I prefer it more than svg sprites 
- I learned how to use the localStorage 

### Continued development

- I did not use bootstrap in my attempt of this app unlike Traversy's video because I purposely did not follow the tutorial when developing this clone. But if I were to continue this app, I would develop a better UI design for this app.
- Overall, I am very happy with the things I learned when I made this app. I will continue to practice Javascript classes in future projects when it's needed.

### Useful resources

- [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - This helped me understand how to use local storage.
